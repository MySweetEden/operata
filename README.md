## Build

You can find more details on publishing here:

https://flet.dev/docs/publish

After setting up your environment, you can use the following command to build the app for your specific operating system:

flet build `<osname>`

Replace `<osname>` with your target operating system (e.g., windows, macos, or linux). This will package the app and create an executable file tailored for your OS, allowing it to be distributed without the need for manual installation of dependencies.

## macOS Setup

You need to grant screen access permissions for the environment youâ€™re using.

- If running in the terminal, allow terminal access.
- If using VS Code, grant access to VS Code.
